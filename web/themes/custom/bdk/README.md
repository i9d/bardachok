## Linters

There are two configs for stylelint. Default is `.stylelintrc` wich is used by IDE's stylelint to highlight quality mistakes. Another config is `.stylintrc-format` extends from default config and also includes rules for code formating based on unified convention. Also there are [prettier](https://prettier.io) to help formating code. ESLing + Prettier are used for JS linting and fixing.
